The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a universal set of goals that are interconnected in a complex network. Exploring the relationship between goals and determining development priorities is essential for advancing the agenda of the United Nations. In this paper, we develop
models to analyze the interlinkages between indicators of the goals, propose Multi-Strategy Evaluation Model(MSE) to assess the priorities of goals, and reveal the dynamic changes in network
structure.

In TASK 1: First, we employ the IAEG-SDG data in China and select 134 representative indicators. Then, the strength of interlinkage is computed using Granger notion of causality to
capture the possible causal relationship between indicators. The threshold for the interlinkage is set to filter the weak Strength of Interlinkage, making the structure of network clearer. In order to
obtain the interconnection strength between each two goals, we calculate the total value of Strength of Interlinkage of each indicator. Finally, a directed network is created.

In TASK 2: We propose two strategies to determine the priorities of the 17 goals: first, we calculate the network centrality of each indicator using eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality
and betweenness centrality. Second, considering the sum of influence of an indicator on the network and the transitivity of influence of network nodes, we introduce the concept of second-order
network. Integrating the two strategies, we calculate the priority rank of the 17 goals and conclude that we should prioritize Goal 8. We cluster the network using community detection and find that
17 SDGs are divided into three categories. If Goal 8 is prioritized, the economic goals represented by it will develop promptly in the next 10 years.
In TASK 3: We select the Goal 1(No Poverty) as the analysis object, remove the network nodes and edges belonging to Goal 1, obtaining the derived sub-graph of the original network. We
recalculate the centrality index and influence index of the sub-network and obtain the new priority ranking of goals, discovering that Goal 6(Clean Water and Sanitation) is prioritized. The changes of priority ranking in the selected regions are in line with local conditions, verifying the rationality of the model. Ultimately, Over Prosperity and Harmonious Coexistence Between People and Nature
are proposed to the UN based on two perspectives. 

In TASK 4 & 5: In order to measure the impact of international events on our network, we define the Consistency Index to measure the consistency between the 17 SDGs of the selected
region and its development strategies. Then, we adjust the consistency index of the goals that are impacted by COVID-19 and summarize that Good Health and Well-being is prioritized. Finally,
based on the three strategies established above, we extend the established model to other fields from the perspectives of network centrality, influence index and consistency index.
